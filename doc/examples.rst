   |ab| implements version 1 of WAMP.

   This is incompatible with version 2 of WAMP which is already implemented in Autobahn|Python as well as Autobahn|JS

   Migration of |ab| to WAMP v2 is coming, but we cannot guarantee a release date.


Tutorials and examples are here to showcase specific areas of Autobahn|Android . They include self-contained, fully working code, but may not cover all features available. For the latter, please consult the :doc:`API reference </_gen/packages>`.

All tutorials and examples are hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnAndroid/tree/master/Demo>`_.
